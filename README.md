# Giftmash

## Local setup

- Install ruby: e.g `rbenv install`
- Make sure that you have sqlite installed.
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install sqlite3`
  * Mac: `brew install sqlite`
- Run in your console: `bin/setup`
- Open: http://localhost:3000

NOTE: `bin/setup` is a script generated by the rails generator. Basically it does:
- `bundle install`
- `bin/rails db:setup`
- `bin/rails s`

## Code decisions

* Use image_url instead of Active Storage. In a real-world scenario, I would have used
  Active Storage to avoid data protection issues, but due to time constraints, I
  opted not to implement it (excluding breaks between commits). The reason image_url poses
  a data protection risk is that the image host can track the IP address of users who
  download the image when visiting this web application.
* Use RSpec instead mintiest because you told me that you are using it.
* Add some styling to make the it more intuitive to use.
