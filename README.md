# Giftmash

## Local setup

- Install ruby: e.g `rbenv install`
- Make sure that you have sqlite installed.
  * Ubuntu: `sudo apt install sqlite3`
  * Mac: `brew install sqlite`
- Run in your console: `bin/setup`
- Open: http://localhost:3000

NOTE: `bin/setup` is a script generated by the rails generator. Basically it does:
- `bundle install`
- `bin/rails db:setup`
- `bin/rails s`

## Code decisions

* Use normal **image_url** instead active storage. In the real world I would have stored
  the image using active storage to avoid problems with data protection, but I am already
  a bit over the time, so I decided not to add it (not including the breaks I took
  in between commits). The reason why using image_url is a data protection problem is, that
  the host of the image could see the IP of the person who download the image (by visiting this
  web application).
* Use RSpec instead mintiest because you told me that you are using it.
* Add some styling to make the it more intuitive to use.
